# Game-Development

## Description
The Alien Invasion project is a Python-based game developed using Pygame, where players defend Earth from waves of extraterrestrial attackers. 

## Objective
Players control a spaceship, maneuvering it to shoot down incoming aliens while avoiding their attacks. As the game progresses, the speed and number of aliens increase, providing a growing challenge. The goal is to achieve the highest score by surviving as long as possible and defeating as many aliens as you can.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Fast-paced action with increasing difficulty as waves of aliens invade.
- **Player Controls**: Move the spaceship left and right. The right arrow key move the spaceship to the right and the left arrow key moves the spaceship to the left. The space bar shoots an alien. Press 'q' to terminate and exit the game. 
- **Score Tracking**: Compete to beat your high score, encouraging replayability.

## Technologies Used:
- Python: Core programming language for game logic and functionality.
- Pygame: A powerful library that provides tools for graphics rendering, input handling, and game state management.
